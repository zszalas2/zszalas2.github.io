 When I was fourteen years old my family immigrated to America. Florida to be more specific. My father had a business Visa, which meant that no one besides him was allowed to participate in any money making activity. My allowance was pretty much lunch money, so I was faced with a decision every day, lunch or weekend fun. After a year or so of being in Florida, I saw that my classmate was making extra cash on the side by buidling websites for local businesses. This was in the age of SEO = white text at the bottom of the website (I hope I'm not showing my age here). 
 I took on learning HTML (the original) and started helping him build websites. Even though I handled most of the business development I still got my hands dirty with some HTML. This pattern of Biz Dev guy would be an unbreakable pattern in my life for years to come. I didn't mind doing biz dev, but I always wanted to be the one working on the product and building things. After my friend moved, the business faded and so did my HTML skills. 
 
 I spent the next ten years starting companies, and being in different business development roles. I was successful in my endeavours and positions, but I never felt like I was "building" anything. There is a saying in biz dev/sales: "You're only as good as last quarter's numbers". At the end of the day no matter how hard I worked, how many accounts I signed, it still felt zero growth. I longed for the ability to create things from nothing. It was around this time that I started looking into Flatiron's Boot Camp program (at this point the online program hadn't existed yet), but I did not pull the trigger.
 
In 2014, I started another company with a few roommates. This company I consider my biggest success, but what's more rewarding is the discovery I made during this process. After having the opportunity to work with the two brightest engineers I've ever met, I got the chance to get my hands dirty again with some code. We had a motto: "We should all be able to perform each other's duties". I started learning JavaScript (Team Treehouse), and I was instantly hooked- again! Hours dissappeared when I studied and played around with code. It became meditative. Then a few months ago I decided to step my game up and become fullstack. It has been a challenge (on many fronts) but the reward has been tremendous. I finally feel like I can build something that can potentially live on forever, get used by thousands, and make in impact in people's lives.
